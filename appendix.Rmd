* This report was built from the
  [`CoVPN/correlates_reporting`](https://github.com/CoVPN/correlates_reporting)
  repository with commit hash `r commit_hash`. A diff of the changes introduced

* The `r hash_algorithm` hash sum of the raw input file,
  `r paste0("\"",data_in_file,"\"")`: `r raw_file_digest`

* The `r hash_algorithm` hash sum of the processed file,
  `r paste0("\"",data_name,"\"")`: `r processed_file_digest`
