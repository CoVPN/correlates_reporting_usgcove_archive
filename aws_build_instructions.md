# Instructions for building reports

## Setting up AMI

This procedure was tested on a `t2.large` AWS instance with Ubuntu 20.04.

### Setting up `R`

To install the most recent version of `R` from CRAN, these dependencies can be installed. 

```bash
# libraries needed to install over https
sudo apt install dirmngr gnupg apt-transport-https ca-certificates software-properties-common

# add CRAN repository to your system sourcesâ€™ list
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E298A3A825C0D65DFD57CBB651716619E084DAB9
sudo add-apt-repository 'deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu focal-cran40/'

# install R
sudo apt-get update 
# will take a couple minutes
sudo apt-get install -y r-base r-base-dev 

# install recent version of pandoc + citeproc
sudo apt-get install -y pandoc
sudo apt-get install -y pandoc-citeproc

# install texlive + extras
sudo apt-get install -y texlive
sudo apt-get install -y texlive-latex-extra
sudo apt-get install -y texlive-fonts-extra libfontconfig1-dev
```

### Setting up GitHub credentials

We will use the `R` package [`credentials`](https://github.com/r-lib/credentials) to set your GitHub credentials to access downloads from GitHub over https. First we need two additional libraries installed via `apt-get`.

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libxml2-dev
```

Log in to GitHub and click on your profile picture thumbnail in the upper right-hand corner. Click on Settings and in the left menu select "Developer Settings". In the new menu, select Personal access tokens. Generate a new token given it an arbitrary name. __Do not leave this page__. The access token is available only this once. Copy the access token to your clipboard.

Instead, head back to your running instance and start `R`. Install the credentials package.

```r
install.packages("credentials")
```

If you are prompted, type "yes" to create your local `R` package library. Or you can log into the session as `root`. 

Next, set your GitHub access token.

```r
credentials::set_github_pat()
```

At the prompt that says `Password for 'https://PersonalAccessToken@github.com':` paste your access token (it may not be visible after being pasted) and hit return. Check your credentials: 

```r
credentials::set_github_pat()
```

The output should read something like `Using GITHUB_PAT from ...` You can now clone the GitHub repository using `git`. Exit `R` and at the command line, `clone` the repository.

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/covpn/correlates_reporting
```

### Setting up the `R` environment using `renv`

Start `R` and install the `renv` and `here` packages.

```r
install.packages("renv")
install.packages("here")
```

Exit out of `R` and from the command line, move into the `correlates_reporting` directory and open an `R` session.

```bash
cd correlates_reporting && R
```

Once `R` has started, it should load the `renv` package automatically. When you get an `R` command prompt, execute the following command to download and configure all necessary `R` packages.

```R
renv::restore()
```

This will take about 45 minutes. During this time you will see messages like this.

````
Installing (some package) [version] ...
  OK [built from source]
````

You now have all of the software needed to build the reports.


## Building the report

### Placing data file

The pipeline expects data to be formatted according to documentation [...](https://github.com/covpn/correlates_reporting/). A data set with this format should be placed in `correlates_reporting/data_raw`.

### Workflow for building reports

#### Updating `renv`

Once an image has been built that includes the GitHub repository, the general work flow will be to
- `git pull` the updated `correlates_reporting` repository;
- open `R` in the `correlates_reporting` directory;
- run `renv::restore()` to update `R` package list;
- exit `R` and proceed to report building below.


#### Updating `_common.R`

The script [`correlates_reporting/_common.R`](https://github.com/CoVPN/correlates_reporting/blob/master/_common.R) is where options can be set to control the analysis. There are only a few variables defined in this file that are important. These are:

- `data_in_file` = the file placed in the `data_raw` folder
- `data_name` = the name of the cleaned data file that will be saved in `data_clean` after the pre-processing script is run
- `study_name` = the name of the study, which is used in report titling and some figures/captions
- `assays` = the immune assays used in the analysis; currently supports any combination of `"bindRBD", "pseudoneutid50", "pseudoneutid80", "liveneutmn50"`
- `include_bindN` = `TRUE`/`FALSE` if the IgG antibodies to N protein should be included in the immunogenicity report
- `times` = for now, this variable should not be touched; the report requires simultaneous analysis of Day 29 and Day 57 markers
- `llods` = named LLOD for each assay
- `lloqs` = named LLOQs for each assay
- `uloqs` = named ULOQs for each assay

All variables defined below this are unlikely to need modification.

#### Immunogenecity report

The general workflow that we have developed relies on the following steps:
1. pre-processing the raw data;
2. creating immunogenecity figures and tables; and
3. compiling the immunogenecity report.

There are `make` commands for each of these three steps.

```bash
make immuno_report
```

The compiled `pdf` report will appear in `_report_immuno/covpn_correlates_immuno.pdf`.

The immunogenecity report is outcome blinded and may be used both to validate the veracity of the assay data and to inform other aspects of the correlates analysis. 

#### Baseline risk score report

The baseline risk score report can be generated using a similar `make` command. 

```bash
make risk_report
```

This compiled `pdf` report will appear in `_report_riskscore/covpn_correlates_report_riskscore.pdf`.

This command also saves an additional data object to the `data_clean` folder that is subsequently used in the correlates of risk reporting detailed below. Thus, __this report must be compiled prior to building the correlates of risk report__.


#### Tier 1 correlates report

After the immunogenecity report has been satisfactorily examined, a correlates report can be generated using `make` commands as follows.

```bash
make cor_report
```

The compiled `pdf` report will appear in `_report_cor/covpn_correlates_cor.pdf`.

For test builds, we recommend turning town the number of bootstrap and permutation resamples in `cor_coxph/code/params.R` by setting the values of the variables [`B`](https://github.com/CoVPN/correlates_reporting/blob/fb1e0c976e6ffb8ed939325dbd20a6c59f44f82b/cor_coxph/code/params.R#L2) and [`numPerm`](https://github.com/CoVPN/correlates_reporting/blob/fb1e0c976e6ffb8ed939325dbd20a6c59f44f82b/cor_coxph/code/params.R#L3) both to `5`.
