# Specifications for CoR_COXPH

General considerations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We will focus on baseline negative vaccine recipients. Baseline negative recipients are also studied as comparison. 
    
    \item The results in the section on Cox regression model fits will be independently programmed, the results in the section on marginalized risk curves will be code-reviewed.
    
    \item The anlyses are repeated once for Day 57 markers and once for Day 29 markers.

\end{itemize}



## Cox regression model fits

### Cox regression model fits for the whole vaccine arm

Due to the two-phase sampling design, the survey package svycoxph function (using twophase function to create the design object) will be used for fitting Cox models and getting confidence intervals and P values. The differences between Day 57 and Day 29 analyses are
\begin{itemize}
    \item Phase 1 ptids in Day 57 analyses are defined by ph1.D57; in Day 29 analyses they are defined by ph1.D29
    \item Phase 2 ptids in Day 57 analyses are defined by ph2.D57; in Day 29 analyses they are defined by ph2.D29
\end{itemize}


Markers to be studied: Day57bindSpike, Day57bindRBD, Day57pseudoneutid50, Day57pseudoneutid8. 

The assays included in assays_to_be_censored_at_uloq_cor need to be censored by ULOQs.

Define the trichotomized versions of these variables as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Let x=log10(ULOQ)*.9999
    \item If more than the top 1/3 of vaccine recipients have value > x, use the cut function to cut at x and the weighted median (Hmisc:wtd.quantile) among those <= x; else use the cut function to cut at the 1/3 and 2/3 quantiles (wtd.quantile). (add -Inf and Inf to the beginning and end of the vector of cut points). Convert the results into a factor 
    \item If the previous cut step fails or if it succeeds but it produces only two categories, use cut() with breaks=3 to trichotomize
    \item Name the variables with a 'cat' at the end, e.g. Day57bindSpikecat
\end{itemize}


Fit syvcoxph models to both the continuous and trichotomized variables, all adjusting for MinorityInd + HighRiskInd + Age (Age may be replaced by SL score later), to make Table 1 for continuous markers and Table 2 for trichotomized markers. Note that multitesting adjustment (q-values and FWER) is done across both continuous and trichotomized markers using kyotil::p.adj.perm, which contains Sue Li's implementation of the Westfall and Young permutation-based multitesting adjustment methods. This can be code-reviewed after the other parts are double-programmed.


The Day 57 results for continuous markers are pasted below with notes:
\begin{center}
    \input{../output/D57/CoR_univariable_svycoxph_pretty_mock}\\
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
    \item No. at-risk = number of phase 1 ptids 
    \item No. cases   = number of phase 1 ptids with EventIndPrimaryD57==1
\end{itemize}
<!-- Average follow-up time \input{../output/CoR_D57_mean_followup_time_vacc_\studyname} days, maximum follow-up time \input{../output/CoR_D57_max_followup_time_vacc_\studyname} days. -->

    \input{../output/D57/CoR_univariable_svycoxph_cat_pretty_mock}\\
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
    \item No. at-risk = estimated number of phase 1 ptids in a given category using inverse probability weights 
    \item No. cases   = estimated number of phase 1 ptids with EventIndPrimaryD57==1 in a given category using inverse probability weights 
    \item Attach rate = no. cases / no. at-risk
    \item P values are for comparison with the Lower level; overall P values are generalized Wald-test p-value of the null hypothesis that the hazard rate is constant across the Lower, Middle, and Upper tertile groups. It can be implemented by comparing a chisquared statistic (estimated effects of middle and high groups * inverse(estimated var matrix) * estimated effects of middle and high groups) with a chiquared distribution of 2 degrees of freedom
\end{itemize}


### Cox regression model fits for subpopulations in the vaccine arm

Two-phase Cox regression models are fitted to subgroups in the vaccine arm for the continuous markers. Results are presented as forest plots. Verification includes programmatic comparison of the numbers presented in the forest plots and visual inspection of the plots to see if they match the numbers in the plots.

\end{center}


The subgroups are as follows. For some subgroups we cannot adjust for all baseline demographic variables, indicated below in parenthesis.

\begin{itemize}
    \item age >= 65
    \item age < 65
    \item at risk (remove HighRiskInd)
    \item Not at risk (remove HighRiskInd)
    \item Comm of color (remove MinorityInd)
    \item White non-Hispanic (remove MinorityInd)
    \item Men 
    \item Women
    \item age<65 and at risk (remove HighRiskInd)
    \item age<65 and not at risk (remove HighRiskInd)
\end{itemize}

## Marginalized risk

The results in this section will be code-reviewed. 

The primary implementation of marginalized risk uses functions from the package marginalizedRisk on CRAN. The marginalizedRisk package is written for a more general purpose. The verification will double program the specific algorithm used to compute the marginalized risk in this report. Because of the specialized nature of the R functions required to implement these methods, the tester will first review the primary programmer's code to gain familiarity with the basic functions for working with survival analysis in R, but will write the program independently after that.

There are four types of curves based on marginalized risks. The first three are for continuous markers and the risk here refers to the marginalized cumulative risk by (inclusive) $t_F$, which is defined as the time of the last observed outcome in the vaccine arm.


Marginalized risk function conditional on $S=s$ for a continuous marker:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Fit a two-phase Cox model to the baseline negative vaccine recipients with baseline covariates and the continuous marker
  \item For each $s$ in 5\%, 6\%, 95\% percentile of the marker values (defined ignoring weights),
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Compute the risk for all phase 2 subjects, but with their marker value set to $s$ instead of their original $S$
    \item Return the weighted mean of the risk
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Controlled VE function conditional on $S=s$ for a continuous marker:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Fit a two-phase Cox model to the baseline negative vaccine recipients with baseline covariates and the continuous marker 
  \item For each $s$ in 5\%, 6\%, ..., 95\% percentile of the marker values (defined ignoring weights),
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Compute the risk for all phase 2 subjects, but with their marker value set to $s$ instead of their original $S$
    \item Return  1-  (weighted mean of the risk) / (placebo overall risk)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Marginalized risk function conditional on $S>=s$ for a continuous marker:
\begin{itemize}
  \item For each $s$ in 0\%, 5\%, ..., 90\% percentile of the marker values (defined ignoring weights),
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Fit a two-phase Cox model to the baseline negative vaccine recipients with baseline covariates using the subset of samples satisfying $S>=s$
    \item Compute the risk for all phase 2 subjects, not just the subset with $S>=s$
    \item Return the weighted mean of the risk
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Controlled VE function conditional on $S>=s$ for a continuous marker:
\begin{itemize}
  \item For each $s$ in 0\%, 5\%, ..., 90\% percentile of the marker values (defined ignoring weights),
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Fit a two-phase Cox model to the baseline negative vaccine recipients with baseline covariates using the subset of samples satisfying $S>=s$
    \item Compute the risk for all phase 2 subjects, not just the subset with $S>=s$
    \item Return  1-  (weighted mean of the risk) / (placebo overall risk)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The last curve is for discrete markers, and it plots the marginalized cumulative incidence rate as a function of time for each subpopulation defined by the discrete marker. The risk here refers to the marginalized cumulative risk at a series of time points.

Marginalized cumulative incidence rate function conditional on $S=s$ for a discrete marker:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Fit a two-phase Cox model to the baseline negative vaccine recipients with baseline covariates and the discrete marker
  \item For each $s$ in 5\%, 6\%, ..., 95\% percentile of the marker values (defined ignoring weights),
  \begin{itemize}
    \item For each time $t$ of interest,
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Compute the risk by (inclusive) time $t$ for all phase 2 subjects, but with their marker value set to $s$ instead of their original $S$
      \item Return the weighted mean of the risk
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
