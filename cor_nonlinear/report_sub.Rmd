# Day `r Day` Univariate CoR: Nonlinear modeling {#cor-nonlinear-Day`r Day`}


To explore nonlinear association and threshold modeling, we fit smoothing spline models with degrees of freedom selected by cross-validation using the mgcv R package.
<!-- and two-phase models using the chngpt R package. -->

Baseline covariates adjusted for: baseline risk score, meeting the protocol randomization stratification criterion for being at heightened risk of COVID (yes or no), `r ifelse(study_name_code=="COVE", "community of color or not", "strata(Region)")`. 
The horizontal lines indicate the overall cumulative risk of the vaccine and placebo arms by Day \protect\input{`r pathCorcoxphOutput`/timepoints_cum_risk_`r study_name`} and its 95\% point-wise confidence interval. Histograms of the immunological markers in the vaccine arm are overlaid. lod = `r round(llods["bindSpike"],1)`, `r round(llods["bindRBD"],1)`, `r round(llods["pseudoneutid50"],1)`, `r round(llods["pseudoneutid80"],1)` for bAb Spike, bAb RBD, PsV nAb ID50, PsV nAb ID80, respectively.}
