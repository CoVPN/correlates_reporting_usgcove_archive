# Day `r Day` Univariate CoR: Nonlinear modeling {#cor-nonlinear-Day`r Day`}


To explore nonlinear association and threshold modeling, we fit smoothing spline models using the mgcv R package and two-phase models using the chngpt R package.

Baseline covariates adjusted for: baseline risk score, meeting the protocol randomization stratification criterion for being at heightened risk of COVID (yes or no), community of color or not. 
The horizontal lines indicate the overall cumulative risk of the vaccine and placebo arms by Day \protect\input{`r pathCorcoxphOutput`/timepoints_cum_risk_`r study_name`} and its 95\% point-wise confidence interval. Histograms of the immunological markers in the vaccine arm are overlaid. lod = `r round(llods["bindSpike"],1)`, `r round(llods["bindRBD"],1)`, `r round(llods["pseudoneutid50"],1)`, `r round(llods["pseudoneutid80"],1)` for bAb Spike, bAb RBD, PsV nAb ID50, PsV nAb ID80, respectively.}
