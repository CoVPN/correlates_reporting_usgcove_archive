# Day `r COR` Univariate CoR: Nonlinear modeling {#cor-nonlinear-Day`r COR`}


To explore nonlinear association and threshold modeling, we fit smoothing spline models with degrees of freedom selected by cross-validation using the mgcv R package.
<!-- and two-phase models using the chngpt R package. -->


```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
  for (a in assays) {
    res = knitr::knit_child(c(here::here('cor_nonlinear', 'risk_plots.Rmd')), quiet = TRUE)
    cat(res, sep = '\n')
  }
```
