# Data processing common to all sub-analyses


* See verification/spec for details
* bAb marker values have been converted from AU/ml to IU/ml.
* All marker values are on the log10 scale. The Delta variables are log10 of fold change. 
* There is no missingness in the markers in the phase 2 sample since we impute the missing
  data here. Only one imputed copy is created.
